I'm trying to get myself together and generate mine own web presence for once.

With social media descending into extraction and suppression, it seems that the dream of the internet needs to return to
its roots. A personal website showcasing my skills&mdash;in code as well in the arts&mdash;seems like a good thing to
have at the moment.

Following the the footsteps of my friend [Regal](https://cobra.monster/), I'm putting together this website using
[Astro](https://astro.build/). A nice static site generator which uses languages I already know (typescript and
markdown) gives me an opportunity to separate content from code.

I am working through their blog tutorial at this very moment, and it's going embarrassingly slowly. I keep getting
distracted by looking up the best way of doing things&mdash;like using the
[address](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/address) and
[time](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/time) tags&mdash;because their example code
doesn't employ it, but I know that it's out there. Or I get bogged down in writing stuff out, as my composition skills
have gotten extraördinarily rusty.

At least I finally have something together.

Current `TODO`s:
* [ ] Flesh out 'About Me'
* [ ] Develop site styling
* [ ] Beautify splash page
